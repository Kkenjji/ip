# Use of AI Declaration

I utilized AI as a support tool to enhance various aspects of coding, 
documentation, and make sure I adhere to the best coding practices. 
In particular, I used AI tools to refine **Javadoc documentation**, 
**check for coding standard violations**, **clarifying JavaFX concepts**, 
and **improving overall code readability**.

AI tools used: ChatGPT

---

## Javadoc Documentation
AI was used to generate well-structured and informative Javadoc comments for classes and methods. 
- Adding missing details such as parameter descriptions and expected behavior.
- Improving readability with proper line wrapping and indentation.

---

## Enhancing Code Readability & Refinement
AI tools were leveraged to detect and rectify coding standard violations, ensuring that the project 
adheres to best practices in Java development.
- Consistent naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes.
- Refactored complex logic for better efficiency and readability.
- Eliminating redundant code and simplifying logic where possible.
- Enhancing method modularity for better reusability and testability.
- Formatting code consistently for improved legibility

## Clarifying JavaFX Concepts
AI was consulted to gain deeper insights into JavaFX components, layouts, and event handling.
Main reason was to improve Clank's UI.
- Understand how JavaFX works.
- Optimize UI layouts for better responsiveness and design consistency.
